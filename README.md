# Subset-Summer
Given a set, and a number, find all possible subsets that sum to that number. 


Real life example:
Suppose your friend says you owe them $20, and shows you an invoice as evidence. The invoice is for $55.
Your frined says that you only owe him for some objets on the invoice, not all of them.
The objects cost [5,10,15,25]
How do you figure out what you are paying for?


Future work:
This program will find A solution, not ALL solutions. I want to find ALL Solutions.

This only works with integers. Originally I tested this with floats, but that caused problems, so I have to figure out how to convert from floats to integers, then back again. 

I would also like to convert this to VBA so I can use it in excel.
