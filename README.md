# Subset-Summer
Given a set, and a number, find all possible subsets that sum to that number. 


Real life example:
Suppose your friend says you owe them $20, and shows you an invoice as evidence. The invoice is for $55.
Your frined says that you only owe him for some objets on the invoice, not all of them.
The objects cost [5,10,15,25]
How do you figure out what you are paying for?

If you have an example that absoultly messes up this code, please let me know.
